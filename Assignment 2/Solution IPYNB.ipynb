      "STRIDE's method principle makes use of combination of calculated backbone torsional angle and hydrogen bond energy to predict secondary structures. The Chou-Fasman method works on the principle examining of relative frequencies of every amino acid in helices, beta sheets and turns using the known protein structures calculated using crystallography (X-Ray) and using these obtained frequencies the probability values (propensity values) for every amino acid were calculated for the occurrence as helix, beta sheet or turn. The type of secondary structure formed by a sequence is predicted using the probability values or  propensity values. The differences in the sequences are significant since the STRIDE's method of prediction is much more accurate than what we are using for the Chou-Fasman. Our method just calculates and predicts the alpha helix and beta strand and assumes that if none of alpha or beta is predicted then it is turn while the STRIDE's method also calculates and predicts turns, coils, bridges and 310 helixes in addition to alpha helixes and beta strand. The method used by STRIDE is more accurate with respect to crystallography also.\n",

    "print(\"STRIDE's method principle makes use of combination of calculated backbone torsional angle and hydrogen bond energy to predict secondary structures. The Chou-Fasman method works on the principle examining of relative frequencies of every amino acid in helices, beta sheets and turns using the known protein structures calculated using crystallography (X-Ray) and using these obtained frequencies the probability values (propensity values) for every amino acid were calculated for the occurrence as helix, beta sheet or turn. The type of secondary structure formed by a sequence is predicted using the probability values or  propensity values. The differences in the sequences are significant since the STRIDE's method of prediction is much more accurate than what we are using for the Chou-Fasman. Our method just calculates and predicts the alpha helix and beta strand and assumes that if none of alpha or beta is predicted then it is turn while the STRIDE's method also calculates and predicts turns, coils, bridges and 310 helixes in addition to alpha helixes and beta strand. The method used by STRIDE is more accurate with respect to crystallography also.\")\n",
